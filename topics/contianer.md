# Contianer
Containerization is a technique that allows software to run reliably regardless of the computing environment. By encapsulating software within isolated environments called containers

# Docker Concepts
  ## Images
- Images are read as templates used to create containers.
- Images are created with the docker build command, either by us or by other docker users.
- Images are composed of layers of other images.
- Images are stored in Docker registry.
 
 ## Containers
 - If an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class - a runtime object.
 - Containers are lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment in which to run programs.
 - Containers are created from images. Inside a container, it has all the binaries and dependencies needed to run the application.

 ## Registries and Repositories
 - A registry is where we store our images.
 - You can host your own registry, or you can use Docker public registry which is called DockerHub.
 - Inside a registry, images are stored repositories.
 - Docker repository is a collection of different docker images with the same name, that have different tags, each tag usually means a different version of the image.
 - DockerHub is a popular service for repositories.
 - Official names are reviewed by DockerHub.
 - If you don't specify a tag, it defaults to latest.
 - Docker will use the local image first if it's available, otherwise it will download it from the network.


# Container Orchestration 
Container orchestration is a process that automates the deployment, management, scaling, networking, and availability of container-based applications.
- Provisioning hosts
- Instantiating a set of containers
- Rescheduling failed containers
- Linking containers together through agreed interfaces
- Exposing services to machines outside of the cluster
- Scaling out or down the cluster by adding or removing containers

## Where does container orchestration fit within the system stack?

Three main functional aspects of what they do include:
- **Service Management:** Labels, groups, namespaces, dependencies, load balancing, readiness checks.
- **Scheduling:** Allocation, replication, resurrection, rescheduling, rolling deployment, upgrades, downgrades.
- **Resource Management:** Memory, CPU, GPU, volumes, ports, IPs.

Non-functional aspects that are important: scalability, availability, flexibility, usability, portability, and security.

## What are some Container Orchestration tools available?

- **Docker Swarm:** Provides native clustering functionality for Docker containers, which turns a group of Docker engines into a single, virtual Docker engine.
- **Google Container Engine:** Google Container Engine, built on Kubernetes, lets you run Docker containers on the Google Cloud.
- **Kubernetes:** An orchestration system for Docker containers. It handles scheduling and manages workloads based on user-defined parameters.
- **Mesosphere Marathon:** Marathon is a container orchestration framework for Apache Mesos that is designed to launch long-running applications.
- **Amazon ECS:** The ECS supports Docker containers and lets you run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
- **Azure Container Service (ACS):** ACS lets you create a cluster of virtual machines that act as container hosts along with master machines that are used to manage your application containers.
- **Cloud Foundryâ€™s Diego:** Container management system that combines a scheduler, runner, and health manager.
- **CoreOS Fleet:** Container management tool that lets you deploy Docker containers on hosts in a cluster as well as distribute services across a cluster.
