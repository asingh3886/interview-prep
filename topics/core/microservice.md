## What are microservices?
 - Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are
 - Highly maintainable and testable - enables rapid and frequent development and deployment
 - Loosely coupled with other services - enables a team to work independently the majority of time on their service(s) without being impacted by changes to other services and      without affecting other services
 - Independently deployable - enables a team to deploy their service without having to coordinate with other teams
 - Capable of being developed by a small team - essential for high productivity by avoiding the high communication head of large teams
