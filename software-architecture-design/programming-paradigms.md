# Programming Paradigms

## Functional Programming
- Process of building software by composing **pure functions**, avoiding **shared state**, **mutable data**, and **side-effects**. 
- **Declarative (what to do)** rather than **imperative(how to do it)**, and application state flows through pure functions. 
- Examples :**JavaScript**, **Python**.

## Structured Programming
- Aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.
- Code will execute the instruction by instruction one after the other. It doesnâ€™t support the possibility of jumping from one instruction to some other with the help of any statement like GOTO, etc. 
**Object-Oriented Programming** is the tool best suited for defining how we cross architectural boundaries with polymorphism and plugins.
